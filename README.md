# Amazon-Clone
🛒 Amazon Clone Homepage
This is a simple Amazon website homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. The project replicates the front-end look and feel of the Amazon home page, including the header, navigation bar, hero section, product sections, and footer. This project is part of my practice to improve HTML & CSS skills and understand layout structuring, responsive design, and UI cloning.
